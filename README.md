# Hotel-Management

 **master lease structure** instead of ownership.
 
**Revenue vs Lease Cost**.

We will assume:

• 70 rooms
• Lease to owner = **$45 per day per room**
• 30-day minimum stay
• Full 100% occupancy (VA contract scenario)

---

# 🔹 Fixed Lease Cost

Per Room:
$45 × 30 = **$1,350 per month**

Full Property:
$1,350 × 70 = **$94,500 per month**

Annual Lease:
**$1,134,000**

# 📌 Break-Even Rate (Lease Only)

Monthly Lease per Room = $1,350

Break-even daily rate:

$1,350 ÷ 30 = **$45 per night**

Anything above $45/day generates positive gross spread.

# 💡 Key Insight

Under lease structure:

• Your cost floor = $45/day
• Every $10 increase in rate adds ≈ $255,500 annually

Example:

$79 vs $65 difference
= $351,120 additional annual revenue

Lease model amplifies pricing upside significantly.

Perfect — now we’ll layer in **occupancy sensitivity** on the lease model.

### Assumptions (No operating costs included)

* 70 total rooms
* Lease cost = **$45/day**
* Monthly lease per room = **$1,350**
* Total monthly lease obligation = **$94,500**
* 30-day stay assumption
* Revenue scenarios: **$65 / $79 / $92 / $110**

We will show:

* Full occupancy (70 rooms)
* 5 vacant rooms (65 occupied)
* 10 vacant rooms (60 occupied)

## 🔹 Scenario A — $65 per Night

| Occupied Rooms | Monthly Revenue | Lease Cost | Monthly Gross Spread | Annual Gross Spread | Margin |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| 70             | $136,500        | $94,500    | $42,000              | $504,000            | 31%    |

# 💡 Strategic Insight

Under a lease model:

* At $79 → Moderate cushion.
* At $92 → Strong operating stability.
* At $110 → Highly resilient business model.

Lease structure magnifies both upside and downside.
