# Hotel-Management

Excellent — now we’re shifting to a **master lease structure** instead of ownership.

This dramatically changes risk, capital required, and IRR profile.

---

# 🔹 STRUCTURE: MASTER LEASE MODEL

You do NOT purchase the property.

You lease all 70 rooms from the owner at:

**$45 per room per day**

You operate it under VA contract housing at higher rates.

---

# 📌 Core Assumptions

• 70 Rooms
• Lease Cost: $45/day
• 30-Day Minimum Stay
• Operating cost already optimized
• Revenue Scenarios: $79 / $92
• 100% contract occupancy assumed (VA housing)

---

# 1️⃣ BASE LEASE COST

## Per Room

$45 × 30 days = **$1,350 per month**

## Entire Property

$1,350 × 70 = **$94,500 per month**

Annual Lease Cost:
$94,500 × 12 = **$1,134,000**

This is your fixed rent obligation.

---

# 2️⃣ OPERATING COSTS (Remaining Expenses)

Previously we assumed total operating cost per room:

$1,657.50 per month

But now:

Lease replaces ownership fixed cost portion.

Let’s isolate actual operational cost (payroll, utilities, supplies, maintenance).

Assume operational cost per room (excluding ownership cost) ≈ **$850/month**

(Realistic for long-term extended stay model.)

---

## Total Monthly Operating Cost

$850 × 70 = **$59,500/month**

---

# 📊 TOTAL MONTHLY EXPENSES UNDER LEASE

| Expense        | Monthly      |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| Lease Payment  | $94,500      |
| Operating Cost | $59,500      |
| Total Expense  | **$154,000** |

Annual Expense:
$1,848,000

---

# 3️⃣ REVENUE SCENARIOS

---

# 🔹 Scenario A – VA @ $79 per night

Monthly Revenue per Room:
$2,368

Total Monthly Revenue:
$2,368 × 70 = **$165,760**

---

### Profit

Revenue: $165,760
Expenses: $154,000

Monthly Profit:
**$11,760**

Annual Profit:
**$141,120**

Margin:
~7%

Very thin margin.

---

# 🔹 Scenario B – VA @ $92 per night

Monthly Revenue per Room:
$2,762

Total Monthly Revenue:
$2,762 × 70 = **$193,340**

---

### Profit

Revenue: $193,340
Expenses: $154,000

Monthly Profit:
**$39,340**

Annual Profit:
**$472,080**

Margin:
~24%

Now we’re in business.

---

# 🔹 Scenario C – VA @ $110 per night

Monthly Revenue:
$232,050

Monthly Profit:
$232,050 − $154,000 = **$78,050**

Annual Profit:
**$936,600**

Margin:
~40%

---

# 📊 LEASE MODEL BREAK-EVEN

Break-even monthly revenue:

$154,000 ÷ 70 = $2,200 per room

Daily Rate Required:

$2,200 ÷ 30 = **$73 per night**

---

# 💡 Break-Even Rate Under Lease = $73/day

Anything below that → you lose money.

---

# 4️⃣ 5-YEAR LEVERAGED IRR (LEASE MODEL)

Since you don’t buy property:

Capital required is mainly:

• Security deposit (3 months lease) = $283,500
• Working capital = ~$250,000
• Renovation = optional

Total Capital ≈ $500K–$750K

---

## If operating at $92 rate:

Annual Profit ≈ $472K

Cash-on-Cash:

$472K ÷ $750K = **63% annual return**

5-year return ≈ $2.36M cumulative

IRR ≈ **55–65%**

Lease model dramatically increases IRR but increases operational risk.

---

# 📊 OWNERSHIP vs LEASE COMPARISON

| Category         | Own @ $79 | Lease @ $92 |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Capital Required | $3.3M     | $750K       |
| Annual Profit    | $597K     | $472K       |
| Equity Growth    | Yes       | No          |
| IRR              | 33%       | 60%+        |
| Risk             | Moderate  | Higher      |
| Asset Ownership  | Yes       | No          |
| Exit Value       | High      | Low         |

---

# 📌 Strategic Insight

Lease model:

• Much higher IRR
• Much lower capital
• No asset appreciation
• Sensitive to vacancy
• Sensitive to lease renewal

Ownership model:

• Lower IRR
• Higher wealth building
• More stable

---

# ⚠ Critical Risk Under Lease

If occupancy drops to 60 rooms at $92:

Revenue:
$2,762 × 60 = $165,720

Expenses still = $154,000

Monthly Profit:
$11,720

Margin collapses quickly.

Lease model requires strong contract guarantees.

---

# 💡 Final Strategic Recommendation

If you secure:

• 12–24 month guaranteed VA contract
• Payment direct from agency
• Escalation clauses

Then lease model can outperform ownership dramatically.

Without contract guarantee → lease risk increases significantly.
