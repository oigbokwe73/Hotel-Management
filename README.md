# Hotel-Management

 **master lease structure** instead of ownership.
**Revenue vs Lease Cost**, and remove the per-room operating cost entirely as requested.

We will assume:

• 70 rooms
• Lease to owner = **$45 per day per room**
• 30-day minimum stay
• Full 100% occupancy (VA contract scenario)

---

# 🔹 Fixed Lease Cost

Per Room:
$45 × 30 = **$1,350 per month**

Full Property:
$1,350 × 70 = **$94,500 per month**

Annual Lease:
**$1,134,000**

# 📌 Break-Even Rate (Lease Only)

Monthly Lease per Room = $1,350

Break-even daily rate:

$1,350 ÷ 30 = **$45 per night**

Anything above $45/day generates positive gross spread.

# 💡 Key Insight

Under lease structure:

• Your cost floor = $45/day
• Every $10 increase in rate adds ≈ $255,500 annually

Example:

$79 vs $65 difference
= $351,120 additional annual revenue

Lease model amplifies pricing upside significantly.

If you'd like next, I can:

• Add occupancy sensitivity (5–10 vacant rooms)
• Build a graphical investor-style chart
• Create a government proposal pricing summary
• Or model blended pricing tiers (long-term vs short-term rooms)
